# Mulitplayer Snake
Made for my project based coursework for A level.
This was my first introduction to programming with objects using javascript.
The game involves using 1 to 2 players, one using WASD and the other using arrow keys
Games are timed, where the winner is the longest snake
Features includes collision detection against the players self and enemy
Also features singleplayer where you can play against an AI with 3 difficulties
Difficulties are easy (random), medium (go to food), and hard (A\* algorithm for collision avoidance with self)
