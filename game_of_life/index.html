					Conway's Game of Life
				</h2>
				<hr/>
				Also known as the <b>Game of Life</b> or simply <b>Life</b>, 
				is a 
				<a href="http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/Cellular_automaton">
					<b>cellular automaton</b> 
				</a>
				devised by the British mathematician 
				<a href="http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/John_Horton_Conway">
					John Horton Conway
				</a>
				 in 1970. It is the best-known example of a cellular automaton.
				The "game" is actually a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is 
				determined by its initial state, needing no input from human players. 
				One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration 
				and observing how it evolves.

					Rules
				</h2>
				<hr/>
				The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite two-dimensional 
				grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, live 
				or dead. Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the 
				cells that are directly horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. 
				At each step in time, the following transitions occur:
				<ol>
					<li>
						Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies (referred to as underpopulation or exposure).
					</li>
					<li>
						Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies (referred to as overpopulation or overcrowding).
					</li>
					<li>
						Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives, unchanged, to the next generation.
					</li>
					<li>
						Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours will come to life.
					</li>
				</ol>
