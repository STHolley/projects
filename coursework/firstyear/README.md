Programming 1: The first introduction to programming within the university.

Programming 2: Done in the second semester, adapts on the skills from Programming 1.

Computer Architecture: Using assembly language for small processing tasks.

Some if all projects may be incomplete. This is due to the files being only what was submitted, not all files required for the tasks. This mostly contains self written code.
