    <string name="faq_q2">What happens if I am outside of Northumberland, can I still use the app ?</string>
    <string name="faq_a2">Yes, you can but all the destinations in the app are in Northumberland.</string>

    <string name="faq_q3">How do I find the closest destination near me?</string>
    <string name="faq_a3">Go to the homepage, press the &lt;b&gt;Nearby&lt;/b&gt; bar at the bottom of the screen. This will show the top 3 closest locations to you.</string>

    <string name="faq_q4">How do I log out?</string>
    <string name="faq_a4">Go to the &lt;b&gt;Settings&lt;/b&gt; option in the side navigation bar. On the bottom of the menu there will be a \'logout\' button.</string>

    <string name="faq_q5">Do I require internet access to use the app?</string>
    <string name="faq_a5">To use the app you need to have mobile data and location services enabled.</string>

    <string name="faq_q6">I have arrived at the destination but the &lt;b&gt;Location Nearby&lt;/b&gt; button has not shown up, what do I do?</string>
    <string name="faq_a6">Usually problems like this will be fixed if you restart the app. Also make sure that you have a stable internet connection and location services are still enabled.</string>

    <string name="faq_q7">How do I search for a location by its category?</string>
    <string name="faq_a7">The app will only recognise a search for categories if a &lt;b&gt;\'#\'&lt;/b&gt; symbol precedes the search term. E.g. &lt;b&gt;#garden&lt;/b&gt; will show all gardens.</string>

    <string name="faq_q8">How do I get directions to a location?</string>
    <string name="faq_a8">To display a route to a location on the map, in either the &lt;b&gt;Near Me&lt;/b&gt; section or the &lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt; section after a search, tap the &lt;b&gt;More&lt;/b&gt; button next to the location. On the new location page, tap the &lt;b&gt;Get Directions&lt;/b&gt; button and a route should display on your map. &lt;i&gt;Note that from here you can drag a panel from the right with more detailed directions.</string>

    <string name="faq_q9">The attraction I’m looking for isn’t showing up in the results?</string>
    <string name="faq_a9">If you are sure you have made no spelling errors in your search terms, type &lt;b&gt;#all&lt;/b&gt; into the search bar and check the results shown. &lt;b&gt;#all&lt;/b&gt; will display all the locations in our app. We apologise if your attraction is still not showing as this means it is not yet in our database.</string>

    <string name="faq_q10">Will the app make posts on my Facebook/Google?</string>
    <string name="faq_a10">The app will not make any posts to your social media without your knowledge or permission. Social media posts will only be made if you decide to share an achievement from the achievement page.</string>

    <string name="faq_q11">How can I share my progress with friends?</string>
    <string name="faq_a11">When you unlock achievements, a Facebook logo will appear next to the now colourful logo. You can press this to share the achievement logo directly to Facebook. You can also press the share symbol next to this button to share a certificate of your achievement as a link, using any messaging platform you desire.</string>

    <string name="faq_q12">The app is too bright, is there a dark mode?</string>
    <string name="faq_a12">Go to the &lt;b&gt;Settings&lt;/b&gt; page, turn the switch next to &lt;b&gt;Enable Dark mode&lt;/b&gt; on and the app theme will change immediately.</string>

    <string name="faq_q15">I can only visit attractions with disabled access, is there any help for me?</string>
    <string name="faq_a15">Go to the &lt;b&gt;Settings&lt;/b&gt; page, turn the switch next to &lt;b&gt;Disability Access Required&lt;/b&gt; on and then only locations that have disabled access will appear on the map/will be searchable.</string>

    <string name="faq_q16">How do I unlock achievements?</string>
    <string name="faq_a16">For location specific achievements, you must travel to the location linked to that achievement. Once you are close the location, press the &lt;b&gt;Location Nearby&lt;/b&gt; button, aim your camera at the location and press &lt;b&gt;Snap&lt;/b&gt;. This will unlock the achievement. For other achievements, follow the instructions in the achievement description.</string>

    <string name="faq_q17">An achievement isn’t unlocking?</string>

    <string name="ha_loc_1_name">The Cheviot</string>
    <string name="ha_loc_1_date">N/A</string>
    <string name="ha_loc_1_short">The highest point in Northumberland, around a mile away from the Scottish border.</string>
    <string name="ha_loc_1_long">At a height of 815.3 metres, The Cheviot claims the title as the highest point in the county of northumberland, but is often just referred to as a ‘bog’. However, this gigantic peak has more history than meets the eye. As well as being an age-old extinct volcano, the peak has also played a large part in recent history, acting as the crash site of a Boeing B-17 Bomber during the second world war. Although most of the wreckage has since been removed from the site, there are still some pieces of the aircraft which are visible.</string>

    <string name="ha_loc_2_name">Hadrian\'s Wall</string>
    <string name="ha_loc_2_date">128 AD</string>
    <string name="ha_loc_2_short">A megastructure which was the former north-west frontier of the roman empire.</string>
    <string name="ha_loc_2_long">One of England\'s greatest landmarks, Hadrian\'s Wall stretches 73 miles and still remains strong after being built in 128 AD. It is a UNESCO World Heritage site and is filled with archaeological sites and history from start to finish. The Wall\'s pure stature has inspired popular modern day media such as Game of Thrones, and has always claimed a spot on any list of must-see attractions. Contrary to popular belief, Hadrian\'s Wall does not mark the English/Scottish border.</string>

    <string name="ha_loc_3_name">Haydon Bridge</string>
    <string name="ha_loc_3_date">1190 AD</string>
    <string name="ha_loc_3_short">A small village situated near major Northumberland attractions with the South Tyne river at its heart.</string>
    <string name="ha_loc_3_long">Despite what many people think, Haydon Bridge is not actually a bridge, but instead a small village divided by the South Tyne river. The village is however named after Old Haydon Bridge which was originally erected in the medieval era but replaced in 1776 and has been subject to many repairs over the years. It has now been restricted to pedestrian use and offers beautiful views of the village and river. Haydon Bridge was the birthplace of famous painter John Martin, known for paintings such as The Destruction of Pompeii and Herculaneum and The Plains of Heaven. The luxurious Langley Castle Hotel is just around the corner, making Haydon Village a location packed with history and sites.</string>

    <string name="ha_loc_4_name">Alnwick Castle</string>
    <string name="ha_loc_4_date">1096 AD</string>
    <string name="ha_loc_4_short">The second largest inhabited castle in the country, used in Films &amp; Television Programmes such as Harry Potter and Downton Abbey.</string>
    <string name="ha_loc_4_long">Alnwick Castle is the family home of the Percy’s, or more commonly, the seat of the Duke and Duchess of Northumberland. It has been their family’s home for over 700 years, and has played host to many iconic characters from the big and small screen, such as Harry Potter, The Crawley Family from Downton Abbey, and more recently even Transformers. This has been incorporated into the regular goings on in Alnwick Castle, with Broomstick Lessons and the ‘Dragons’ Quest’ activity suitable for the whole family. The castle has a poisonous garden where a wide range of plants such as nightshade and hemlock grow, supposedly included by the Duchess to educate others about how dangerous plants can be. Parking is £3 if you are driving to this location, and family tickets to gain access to everything the castle has to offer are less than £50.</string>
