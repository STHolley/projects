# Team Project
Worked as a team of 9 to create an app for a given task. Our task was a tourism app for the county of Northumberland.

My role was the lead developer.

To test the app, it is best to install from the link below for reasons also stated below.

Code is commented for each function as to who initially created it and who modified it.

According to the GIT graph for this project, I was responsible for 9394 additions to the code as well as 5144 deletions.

All of my code was self written, so none of those additions or deletions includes generated, imported, or copied code.

# How to install:
Either use the APK download link from the website (Only works on mobile devices) or use the provided APK file inside the ZIP submission.

If building and running from android studio or other apps to build from the source code, Facebook will not work as your hash key will not be registered with Facebook.

For questions when running the app, consult the user guide on the website or FAQ within the app in the navigation menu.

For additional help on specific screens, there is a help icon in the top right with information on how the screen works.
